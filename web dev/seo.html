        code of the website.As search engiens can see the source code of the

    <ol>
      <h4><li>Title tag</li></h4>
      <p>
        This is arguably the most important tag that you need to be familiar
        with when it comes to increasing your rankings.SEE TITLE
        
      </p>
      <h4><li>Meta description tag</li></h4>
      <p>
        Right after the title tag, the meta tag is an absolute must for anyone
        who is serious about their SEO.Think of the meta description as the
        synopsis on the back of a book. The title is the heading, and the meta
        description is the extra couple sentences of information that further
        describe what the content is about.If you do this right, your meta
        description will not only help you rank well on Google, but it will also
        sell the “click” with compelling copy.SEE META.discription

      <h4><li>Header tags</li></h4>
      <p>
        The header tags don’t just help organize your content for readers. It
        also helps your SEO.When you tag all of your topical headings throughout
        the post, you tell search engines exactly what your content is
        discussing.This is how Google creates the snippets you’ll sometimes see
        when looking for a topic.THE HEADING THAT YOU JUST SAW
      </p>
      <h4><li>Links and anchor text tags</li></h4>
      <p>
        Throughout your content, you’re probably going to link to different
        websites.Most people will just add the link and forget about the anchor
        text, which is unfortunate for SEO endeavors.Your anchor text should
        answer these questions for Google.If you’re linking to someone else’s
        website and you provide a good anchor tag, it will help their rankings
        more than the link alone. And if you’re linking to a page on your own
        website, it will help your own domain authority because it keeps your
        content <a href="https://www.duckduckgo.com">HERE YOU GO</a>
      </p>
      <h4><li>Image alt tags</li></h4>
      <p style="float: left; width: 40%">
         Occasionally, people will also search under the “Images”
        tab.And when they do that, the SEO game is a little bit different.Search
        engines can’t read images, but search engines can read words.This means
        that, to have a chance for your images to rank on Google, you need to
        include alt tags on all of your screenshots and photos.That way, when
        someone is searching the “Images” tab, they can still find your
        content.IMAGE ON YOUR RIGHT PLEASE
